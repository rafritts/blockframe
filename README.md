In its current form, this repo is nothing more than a educational tool for 
myself to learn how blockchain works.  If you would like to use it as well, the 
entry point for the app is BlockChainApp.java. 

To run this app, you will need java and maven installed.  

Simply run the command `mvn package` to build the jar, and the run the command
`java -jar target/blocks-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` from the parent
directory.
